# Hibernate advanced: One-to-many Relationship and Fetch Types

## Description
Experiment with concepts of Hibernate, ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping), one-to-many mapping, and fetch types. In this project, we can see how:
* Configure Hibernate in the XML file (/hibernate-advanced-one-to-many-fetch-types-demo/src/hibernate.cfg.xml)
* Create entities in which Java classes or their objects will be mapped to the database's table (entity.eagerFetchType/... ) (entity.lazyFetchType/...)
* Establish one-to-many mapping and fetch types between entities
* Map objects to tables of MySQL (demo/...)
* Test features of lazy fetch types of one-to-many mapping
* Test features of eager fetch types of one-to-many mapping
